        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a passionate and disciplined Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and modern web practices. 
            I come from a Computer Applications background and have been consistently building my skills with one clear goal: 
            to create clean, responsive, and user-focused web experiences.<br>
            I believe good front-end development is not just about writing code, but about understanding structure, accessibility, and clarity.
            That’s why I focus deeply on fundamentals like semantic HTML, layout systems, and reusable components instead of rushing through technologies.
            <br>
            As a fresher, I may not have industry experience yet, but I bring something equally valuable — consistency, curiosity, and a strong willingness to learn and improve every day.
            I enjoy breaking down problems, learning how things work under the hood, and turning ideas into functional interfaces.
            <br>
            I’m currently looking for an opportunity where I can contribute as a front-end developer,
            grow under guidance, and add real value to a team through dedication and continuous improvement.
