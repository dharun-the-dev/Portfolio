# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using core front-end technologies.
It showcases who I am, my approach to front-end development, and the projects I have worked on.

The goal of this project is to present a clean, semantic, and accessible structure
while keeping the design simple and user-focused.

## About Me

I’m a passionate and disciplined Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in HTML and CSS.
I come from a Computer Applications background and am consistently building my skills
to create clean, responsive, and user-focused web experiences.

I believe good front-end development is not just about writing code,
but about understanding structure, accessibility, and clarity.
That’s why I focus deeply on fundamentals like semantic HTML and layout systems
instead of rushing through technologies.
